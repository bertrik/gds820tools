gds820tools
===========

Set of tools for the Instek GDS-820S oscilloscope:

* decode.c: decoder for image data captured over USB
* gds820\_rs232.py: a Python library for the oscilloscope's rs232 connection
* dump.py: Simple tool to dump channels to a CSV file
* graph.py: Uses pyqtgraph to produce an updating representation of the oscilloscope display. Currently too slow to be real-time.
